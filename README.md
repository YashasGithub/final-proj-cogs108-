this is my final project for my cogs 108 class which analyses two datasets containing data on students including academic information, demographic information, and personal information. the aim of this project was to find whether or not a parent's education level affected a student's academic prowess, and if so, what form that effect took.

for the sake of privacy of my group members, there is no public link to see the project, but it can be found and viewed by navigating to "FinalProject_Group043-FA24.ipynb".
